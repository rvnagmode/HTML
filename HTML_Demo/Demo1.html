        Sobers Trophy (ICC Men's Cricketer of the Decade): 2011–2020; Sir Garfield
        Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) in 2017 and 2018; ICC Test Player

        he was awarded the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category
        in 2017[9] and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the highest sporting honour in
        India, in 2018.[10]
